title: Orderflow encryption and attestation
description: coming soon

This page outlines how orderflow is end-to-end encrypted in BuilderNet.

## Key ports

Every builder node exposes these key ports used for orderflow communication:

| Port | Use                                                   | Encryption                        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 443  | Receive orderflow from operator, users, wallets       | Locally generated TLS certificate |
| 5544 | Receive orderflow from BuilderNet nodes and Flashbots | Locally generated TLS certificate |
| 7936 | Serving the locally generated TLS certificate         | Attested TLS (aTLS)               |

## Orderflow encryption

Orderflow sent to a builder node is end-to-end encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
Once inside BuilderNet, orderflow is only accessible to services running inside BuilderNet nodes.

Each builder node creates a local TLS certificate on startup, and uses this certificate for receiving orderflow on ports 443 and 5544.
The private key for this certificate provably resides only inside the TEE instance.

Client requests require the server to own the private key for this particular TLS certificate.

## TEE attestation of the certificate

TEE attestation allows you to verify that a given TLS certificate belongs to a particular VM image (with specific codebase and configuration).
On every builder node, an API on port 7936 serves the local certificate over an aTLS attested channel.

Read more about aTLS in the [Constellation documentation](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/blob/main/internal/atls/README.md).

As part of the aTLS handshake, the client (i.e. user) can verify that the server runs inside a TEE instance with specific measurements
(i.e. specific codebase and configuration).

You can use [this tool](https://github.com/flashbots/cvm-reverse-proxy/blob/get-measurements/cmd/attested-get/main.go) to get the certificate with TEE attestation:

```bash
# Install attested-get
go install github.com/flashbots/cvm-reverse-proxy/cmd/attested-get

attested-get \
    --addr=https://rpc.buildernet.org:7936/cert \
    --out-measurements=measurements.json \
    --out-response=builder-cert.pem
```

Here's an example command for an attested request to the Flashbots BuilderNet node, matching expected measurements from https://measurements.buildernet.org:

```
attested-get \
    --addr=https://rpc.buildernet.org:7936/cert \
    --expected-measurements=https://measurements.buildernet.org \
    --out-response=builder-cert.pem
```

You can then use the `builder-cert.pem` file to verify the attested TLS certificate in your future requests to BuilderNet.
