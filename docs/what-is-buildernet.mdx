# Welcome to BuilderNet

BuilderNet is a decentralized block building network for Ethereum.

It’s a secure, performant, and globally distributed network to collaboratively build Ethereum blocks, where
transactions stay provably private and MEV value is permissionlessly redistributed back to users.

By maximizing participation in block building, BuilderNet reinforces the continued decentralization and resilience of public blockchains like Ethereum. Read the full mission statement [here](/blog/introducing-buildernet).

:::info

This is the initial release, and we expect the system to evolve rapidly. Updates are posted to [the forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/c/buildernet/31)!

:::

## Operators

BuilderNet nodes are initially operated by Flashbots, Beaverbuild, and Nethermind, with more operators added in the coming months. Teams can express interest in becoming an operator through [the interest form](https://www.notion.so/flashbots/1356b4a0d8768094a07be796f7615b30).

In the future all operations will be permissionless.

## Key Features

1. Open-source block builder instances run by node operators.
2. Instances share orderflow and coordinate their bids with each other.
3. Orderflow providers can verify the builder instance software, and securely send orderflow to them.
4. Transactions stay provably private, with builder nodes running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
5. Users are refunded the value their orderflow contributes to the final value of the blocks.
6. Anyone can audit and [contribute](/docs/how-to-participate) to the open source block builder that powers BuilderNet.
